##Heaven's Gate

We stayed at an unfortunately named but beautiful holiday home overlooking Nelson Bay. The views were incredible.

##The seaside
Kai played in the sand, and actually enjoyed being in the sea. It was the first time he didn't cry the whole time.

##Murry's Brewery
Highly recommended excursion for beer lovers - the pizza is more than big enough for two to share. Try the *Wild Thing* Imperial Stout.

##Tea Gardens Ferry Ride
We caught the (rather expensive) ferry to Tea Gardens from Nelson Bay. The trip was lovely though, and at least one passenger spotted what they belived to be a dolphin.

##Gan Gan Look-out
A walk up the hill from Heaven's Gate, *Gan Gan Lookout* is supposedly the best view in Nelson Bay. Unfortunately, none of the photos I took did it justice, so I tried a panorama.

##Red Neds Gourmet Pies
Apparently famous, Red Neds Gourmet Pies were certainly enourmous. That's a three litre bottle of ginger beer in the picture.

##The gouge
Since my brother-in-law was nice enough to bring a bicycle for me to use, I thought I'd go for a quick ride on our last night there. Unfortunately, Heaven's Gate is at the top of a long and incredibly steep (over 26ยบ, I've been informed) hill. Riding a bike up said hill with a sixpack of beer in a plastic bag hanging from one handle is not recommended.
